# Project Euler Problems

We had an awesome half-credit class at Wheaton College, taught by Tom
Armstrong, where we would come in and do a couple of these problems every week.
They're still good practice, and I'm gonna implement problems in whatever
language I'm currently knee-deep in learning.

So far, just python.
